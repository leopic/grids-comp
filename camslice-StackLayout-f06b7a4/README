StackLayout is a flexible width component based CSS layout
system. It is proposed as an alternative to the popular 
grid style layout systems.

StackLayout uses display:inline-block with negative letter spacing
in a fixed width font (Courier New) in order to achieve a 
floatless, gridless layout system, the components of which can 
be nested within each other to produce virtually any layout.
